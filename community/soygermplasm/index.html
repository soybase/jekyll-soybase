<h2>Soybean Crop Germplasm Committee</h2>

<p>The soybean genomics research community is comprised of scientists with expertise ranging from classical breeding to genomics and cell biology to gene discovery. The genomic resources available for soybean are often poorly understood by non-soybean scientists and funding agencies. Consequently the strengths and needs of the soybean genomics research community are also often poorly understood. It is the mission of the Soybean Genomics Executive Committee (SoyGEC) to advance soybean as a genetic and physiological research system that will result in enhanced availability and nutritional quality of the worldâ€™s premier source of vegetable protein and oil.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this mission, SoyGEC will actively pursue the goal of widening the breadth and scope of existing soybean genomics research. The SoyGEC will proactively communicate with the soybean research community to help define research priorities, and with representatives of federal funding agencies to ensure that research priorities are clearly articulated. When called upon, the SoyGEC will speak on behalf of the research community to commodity board groups and other lay-groups.</p>

<p>The SoyGEC seeks to broaden the number of soybean scientists conducting genomic research and to broaden the diversity of scientific expertise in team research in order to add new dimensions to the scientific and agricultural questions asked. The SoyGEC will encourage research that will target high priority needs of soybean and facilitate training of undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral scientists to prepare a new generation of researchers skilled in research techniques targeted for this crop.</p>

<p>The SoyGEC seeks to ensure excellence in research quality and clarity in communication of needs and priorities. Without encumbering individual initiative, the SoyGEC will encourage coordination of dedicated research teams finding solutions to soybean problems of national and international importance.</p>
