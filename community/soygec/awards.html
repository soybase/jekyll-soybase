                    As a student as Vassar Collage in 1942, Mary Coker Joslin crossed lines Tokyo (from Japan) and Nanda (from Korea), to eventually generate the line Majos. 
                    Majos was used to develop Hampton and Stuart, which were released in 1962, both lines reported high yields, shatter resistance, high oil and disease resistance. 
                    These lines were considered valuable contributions to soybean growers in the Southeastern US. Mary Coker Joslin may be the first recorded female soybean breeder.
