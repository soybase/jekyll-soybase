    The <a href="index.html">Soybean Genomics Executive Committee (SoyGEC)</a> has established career awards for individuals conducting research impacting US soybeans. 
    These will be award at the Biennial Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Soybean Conference. 
    Information on how to nominate a member of the soybean community for an award can be found <a href="nominate.html">here</a>.

                    As a student as Vassar Collage in 1942, Mary Coker Joslin crossed lines Tokyo (from Japan) and Nanda (from Korea), to eventually generate the line Majos. 
                    Majos was used to develop Hampton and Stuart, which were released in 1962, both lines reported high yields, shatter resistance, high oil and disease resistance. 
                    These lines were considered valuable contributions to soybean growers in the Southeastern US. Mary Coker Joslin may be the first recorded female soybean breeder.

                    Dr. Bernard was a USDA-ARS Research Geneticist at the University of Illinois who made immense contributions to soybean genetics and breeding including developing the Clark and Harosoy near-isogenic line collections, 
                    and the development of Williams, a soybean line that occupied a substantial portion of USA acerage in the 1970s. 
                    Those contributions continue to be utilized by soybean geneticists, breeders and growers today.
