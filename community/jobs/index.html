                A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Ames, Iowa.
                This project will use a combination of analyses utilizing gene families, synteny relationships, genetic association results, and published gene functional information, to catalog and evaluate the genes involved in domestication in crops within the legume plant family. 
                This opportunity will involve: developing and applying methods in computational biology and artificial intelligence to gather information about gene function in the legume family; using the results to identify gene correspondences at several taxonomic levels. 
                The participant will learn and apply methods in computational biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence, including statistical methods of marker-trait association, methods for determining syntenic relationships and for calculating and representing pan-genome relationships, methods for inferring gene families, and methods for inferring evolutionary events from large collections of gene families.
                <b>This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.</b>
                <br>A more detailed position description and required qualifications can be found <a href="https://www.zintellect.com/Opportunity/Details/USDA-ARS-MWA-2026-0012" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
