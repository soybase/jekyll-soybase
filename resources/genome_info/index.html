<p>
  Since the release of the first full soybean genome assembly in 2010, assemblies have been generated for more than 50 accessions, including multiple assemblies for the first reference, Williams 82 (Wm82).
</p>

<p>
  There are several nomenclature patterns for the assemblies and annotations. The pattern used by the DOE-JGI and SoyBase has generally taken the form Wm82.a4.v1, with the middle field ("a4") indicating assembly version and the last field (v1) indicating the annotation version. Within the SoyBase and LegumeInfo Data Store, the pattern takes the form Wm82.gnm4.ann1 -- again, with the middle field ("gnm4") indicating assembly version and the last field (ann1) indicating the annotation version.
